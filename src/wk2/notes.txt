Task 1
Modify budget (budget2)
Ask the user for a limit
    Make sure limit is between 200 and 1000
        if not, end the program: "Sorry, but you entered invalid values"

Only allow user to enter and expense value that is 15% or less than their budget
    if not, break out of loop and output sorry message

Bonus: allow user enter a yearly value and you transform it to a
        monthly value
